Issues & Pull Requests (not for Profiles)
Creating an Issue
Before creating an Issue for features/bugs/improvements please follow these steps:

Note: this does not apply to creating/editing your profile

search existing issues before creating a new issue (has someone raised this already)
if it doesn't exist create a new issue giving as much context as possible (please select the correct Issue type, for example bug or feature)
all Issues are automatically given the label status: waiting for triage. Please wait until the maintainers review the Issue and update the labels
look out for when the Issue label changes to status: ready for dev
comment on the Issue asking for it to be assigned to you (do not tag maintainers as all maintainers receive your comment notifications)
only start working on this issue (and open a Pull Request) when it has been assigned to you - this will prevent confusion, multiple people working on the same issue and work not being used.
Working on an Issue (get it assigned to you)
Before working on an existing Issue please follow these steps:

look out for the Issue label status: ready for dev (if it does not have this label, your work might not be accepted)
comment asking for the issue to be assigned to you (do not tag any maintainers as all maintainers receive your comment notifications)
after the issue is assigned to you, you can start working on it
do not enable GitHub Actions on your fork
reference the Issue in your Pull Request (for example closes #123)
Notes:

any issues that have no activity after 2 weeks will be unassigned and re-assigned to someone else
only request to be assigned an issue if you know how to work on it
Reviewing Pull Requests
We welcome everyone to review Pull Requests, it is a great way to learn and network.

DOs
be kind and respectful, we use inclusive, gender neutral language (for example they/them instead of guy/man)
use inline comments to explain your suggestions
use inline suggestions to propose changes
DON'Ts
don't be rude, disrespectful or aggressive
do not repeat feedback, this creates more noise than value (check the existing conversation), use GitHub reactions if you agree/disagree with a comment
do not blindly approve pull requests to improve your GitHub contributors graph
